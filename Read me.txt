# Task Manager App

A full-stack mobile application built to demonstrate my skills in React Native and Node.js development. This app allows users to sign up, log in, and manage tasks (create, read, update, delete) with a seamless user experience. It was developed as a test project for [Company Name] to evaluate my capabilities in frontend and backend development.

## Features
- **Authentication:** Secure signup and login using email and password with JWT-based sessions.
- **Task Management:**
  - View all tasks on the Home screen with pull-to-refresh.
  - Add new tasks with title and description.
  - View, edit, or delete tasks via a details screen.
- **Logout:** Clear session and return to login screen.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React Native Paper for a clean, modern look.
